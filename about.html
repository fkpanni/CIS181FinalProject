      <h2>Fahd Khan - Developer & Francophile</h2>
      <p>I'm a Computer Science student at Illinois Institute of Technology. While my technical skills span sofware development, design, marketing, and cybersecurity, I'm also passionate about French culture and language.
      My interest in France began with French music and aesthetic, which led me to start learning the language. As I combined my web development practice with my growing appreciation for French culture, this castle exploration project naturally emerged.

      Building this site allows me to merge my technical skills with cultural interests. I'm implementing clean, efficient code while ensuring the design reflects the elegance of French architecture.
